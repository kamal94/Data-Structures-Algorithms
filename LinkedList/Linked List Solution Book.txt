Linked List Solution Book

2.1
	Write code to remove duplicated from an unsorted linked list
	FOLLOW UP
	How would you solve this provlem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?

Ans:
	With temporary buffer:
	As we go through linked list, we check for the node's value in a hashmap, and if the value doesn't exist we store the node's value in the hash map. If the value does exist, the current node is a duplicate, and we remove that node from the linekd list.
	Without temporary buffer:
	Since we can not store the value of any node in a buffer, we must compare every node in the list, which means we would get a traversal like the insertion sort, with a O(n^2).
